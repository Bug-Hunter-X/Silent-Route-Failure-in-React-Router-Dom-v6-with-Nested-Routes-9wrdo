This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6: silent failure when navigating to incorrect or misconfigured nested routes. The bug showcases how a simple typo or missing component in a nested route can lead to unexpected behavior, such as a blank screen or incorrect rendering, without any clear error messages. The solution demonstrates how to handle such errors gracefully by using error boundaries and implementing more robust route handling techniques.  This can include better input validation and error handling in the route definitions. The example is designed to help developers quickly understand and address this frustrating issue.
