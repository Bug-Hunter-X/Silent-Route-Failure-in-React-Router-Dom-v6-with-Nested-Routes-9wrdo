In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist or is misconfigured. This leads to unexpected behavior, often silently failing without clear error messages.  The problem is exacerbated when nested routes are involved, making debugging challenging. For instance, if a route path is incorrect or a component within a nested route throws an error, it can prevent the entire nested structure from rendering properly. The error might manifest as a blank screen, incorrect component display, or unexpected routing behavior. The lack of explicit error feedback makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact source of the problem. This behavior is different from previous versions, making it a significant source of confusion for developers migrating to v6.
